# What is DyRel.py?

DyRel is a live environment for relational programming in Python. Its key features are:

- **Liveness**

	The program you're working on is always up and running, it is live and
	talking to you at any time. You have instant feedback on your actions.
	This allows for much better programming experience and more productive
	development.

- **Incrementality**

	The effects on the system add up incrementally, just like they do in the
	real world. No need to necessarily restart, recompile, reassemble from
	the ground up when you make a slight change. Everything is made with
	changeability and incrementality in mind.

- **Reactivity**

	Some things are defined in terms of the others. When these other things
	change, the first ones automatically change accordingly.

- **Relational model**

	All your program state is specified with relational model instead of the
	more usual object graphs. This allows for much more uniform handling of program
	logic.

- **Derivation**

	You specify basic facts and rules that describe how to deduce more knowledge
	about your domain. The system maintains derived information in an
	incremental and reactive way.
